                <p>Despite the scale and audacity of Resurrection City, it doesn't hold the same grip on the American consciousness that other major events of the Civil Rights movement do. RC was relentlessly covered by the national media in the summer of 1968; still, its imprint on American collective memory hardly registers, unlike the Million Man March, the Montgomery bus boycotts, Bloody Sunday, the federally-enforced desegregation of a school in Little Rock, or Dr. King's 1963 speech just a stone's throw away at the Lincoln Memorial. Much like the Civil Rights movement as a whole, and even Martin Luther King, Jr., Resurrection City was deeply unpopular in white middle-class social and political circles at the time. And even today, many historians consider Resurrection City to be a “failure,” a political experiment that was overwhelmed by its ambition - in stark contrast to aspects of the Civil Rights Movement that have become rehabilitated and sanitized. But as this digital atlas illustrates, the legacy of Resurrection City shouldn't be judged on concrete outcomes alone - it is a lesson in process and organizing. In this section, we chart the various factors that have shaped the legacy of Resurrection City - its afterlives - and highlight the core insights that it offers to social justice organizing and cultural landscape preservation.</p>

                <p>From the outset, Resurrection City was burdened by skepticism outside and within the Civil Rights movement. Establishment politicians and policymakers were largely opposed to permitting the protest in the immediate aftermath of Dr. King's assassination and the urban uprisings that had roiled cities across the country - including in Washington, D.C. - earlier that year. Nash Castro, the National Park Service's Director of the National Capital Parks at the time, played a key role in enabling RC to happen. Castro was the main liaison between SCLC organizers and federal officials and helped to negotiate the event permit allowing Resurrection City to unfold on the National Mall (a national park). Castro relayed his experiences from the summer of 1968 in a lengthy oral history  and describes the deep-rooted resistance to permitting the use of West Potomac Park for the Resurrection City, not only from lawmakers, but even from members of the public who communicated their disapproval through letters - like these Ohio and Oregon residents. </p>

                <p>Media coverage of Resurrection City was rarely favorable. Reporters fixated on the perceived "disorder" of Resurrection City as a community, which they saw reflected in the modest, handmade residential structures, in the torrential rains that flooded parts of the site, and above all in the multiracial working poor that populated it.</p>

                    <p>"Thus the general level of the nation's insensitivity and unawareness was in part attributable to a press that deals often in sensationalism, personalities and in protecting big business . . . Thus a nation largely uninformed was challenge to judge the personal behavior of poor people rather than the collective behavior of the Congress. Given the press preferences for problems of process rather than the purpose of the Poor People's Campaign, the adversaries of the poor exploded those problems out of proportion in order to avoid the issues of inequality in our economic structure. From mud to personality differences in Resurrection City occupied their time rather than the cries for food, jobs, and opportunity that brought Resurrection City into being."</p>

                    <p>Disagreements within the SCLC and partner organizations also affected the shape and trajectory of Resurrection City. There were internal conflicts over how the encampment should present: should it be a model city, as Ralph Abernathy proposed, or a replica of the dysfunctions that plagued poor communities? Despite these tensions (along with the constant rain, negative press, and limited resources), Resurrection City symbolized and realized the aspirations of community empowerment and autonomy. Residents who had journeyed from across the country to populate RC came together in the nation's capital to build what they called the “City of Hope” together - and they took these lessons in organizing back to their communities once the City was dismantled in June 1968. </p>
                    <p>John Wiebenson, a professor of architecture at the University of Maryland College Park, led the structures committee for RC. Along with fellow architects and planners Tunney Lee, James Goodell, and Kenneth Jadin, Wiebenson was deeply involved in the preliminary planning and early stages of construction. Although RC was always planned as a temporary settlement, the committee was concerned with designing and creating a well-designed, economical, safe, and welcoming environment for all residents. Wiebenson and his colleagues worked closely with residents in the early construction phase, remarking on the personal pride many took in building and customizing their homes. A balance was struck early on between meticulous planning (especially regarding the housing structures themselves, as well as the general layout of RC) and improvisation, especially once the rains began to fall. The planning professionals who shared their expertise with the organizers at RC understood that this was a unique opportunity to highlight how places weren't just composed of static structures and landscapes; instead, their efforts underscored how place-making - like social justice organizing - is a process. </p>

                    <p>"If, finally, Resurrection City did not show how people should live, it did show the problems too many have in how they do live. For too many people there is a lack of response in service and security needs. For too many, there is a lack of rewarding chance for involvement, locally (as the two boys making a shelter with windows and bunks) or publicly (as the young Marshal from Chicago who was calming people). What Resurrection City was able to give its people is what, too often, other cities and towns do not. And, for some, for a while, it did give not only food and shelter and medical attention, but challenge and involvement, as well."</p>

                <p>Resurrection City's goals for a comprehensive jobs program, improved funding and resources for public education, and targeted outreach to working class poor communities across the country were left largely unfulfilled. These realities, along with the negative coverage at the time, have led many historians and scholars of the Civil Rights movement to label Resurrection City as a failure. But how should social movements be judged? Is success only measured by bills passed or elections won or memorials left to mark an accomplishment? Or should they be measured on different scales? Resurrection City, despite its problems, did have significant, concrete benefits. A truly national movement of protesters and advocates literally inhabited the National Mall for months. Hundreds of residents received medical and dental care while on-site, in many cases for the first time in their lives. New social and political coalitions were formed between African Americans, Chicanos, and Native Americans through Resurrection City. And Americans were confronted with the reality of poverty, embodied by the thousands of people who came to Resurrection City to fight for a different future.</p>

                    <p>"We gained victory in the few concrete programs that passed through Congress... But more importantly, our victory was bigger. Victory is revealing the state of hunger in America. Victory is exposing the scandalous agricultural subsidies to the rich. Victory is the evolution of human sensitivity and consciousness to our brothers' predicament. Victory is the renewed determination of the civil rights movement after the assassination of Dr King for though the dreamer is dead, the dream lives on. Victory is the poor of all races coming together. Victory is to be ignored by the political power of the White House but to have the capacity to respond with the soul power of the black house. Victory is the new relationships created and the lessons learned."</p>
